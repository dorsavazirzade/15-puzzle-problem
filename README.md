# 15-puzzle-problem

This project involves solving the 15-puzzle problem, a classic sliding puzzle game. The puzzle consists of a grid with numbered tiles (1 to 15) and a single empty space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles to achieve a specified order by sliding them into the empty space.

## **Features**
### **1.  Visualization of Puzzle Solving:** 
The program displays each move graphically, showing the progression from the initial state to the solution.
### **2.  Algorithm Support:** 
Implements three search algorithms for solving the puzzle:
* **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
* **Hill Climbing**
* **A-Star Search**
### **3.  User Interaction:** 
Allows the user to select the solving algorithm.
### **4.  Error Handling:** 
The program detects unsolvable puzzles and informs the user.
## **Highlights**
* Efficient handling of different initial configurations and providing feedback for unsolvable cases.
